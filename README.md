# Understanding-CNNs-and-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

The project consists of training a Generative Adversarial Network on the CIFAR10 dataset as well as a few visualization tasks for better understanding how a CNN works.

1. Trained a baseline model for CIFAR10 classification (~2 hours training time)
2. Trained a discriminator/generator pair on CIFAR10 dataset utilizing techniques from ACGAN and Wasserstein GANs (~40-45 hours training time)
3. Used techniques to create synthetic images maximizing class output scores or particular features as a visualization technique to understand how a CNN is working (<1 minute)
